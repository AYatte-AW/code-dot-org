# This script fixes invalid user rows that were added to the database as a result
# of a bug in https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/pull/38026.
# Briefly, there was a bug in that PR that caused user accounts created using the
# join section endpoint (FollowersController#student_register) to be incomplete
# or invalid (i.e. does not pass rails User model validation).  The bug was present
# only in v2020-12-02.0 which was in production from about 12/2/20 2:00pm PST to
# 12/3/20 noon PST.
#
# Rows were invalid in two ways:
# 1. The user created an account with valid data. In this case, only the username
#    field was missing.
# 2. The user created an account with invalid data. In this case, many fields were
#    missing and invalid data was stored in the users table.
#
# Issue 1 is handled in the first section of the script. Here, we call the
# generate_username method on any user record that does not have a username
#
# Issue 2 is handled in the second section of the script. Here, we delete any
# user record that has invalid data. In many cases, students will not be able
# to access these accounts. For a small number of cases (n=25), students have
# accessed these accounts. For the students who successfully joined a section
# (n=9), we will reach out to the teacher to explain the situation.
