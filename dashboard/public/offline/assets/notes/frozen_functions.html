    <p>Hi, I’m Chris Bosh. I’m a professional basketball player, and I coded in college.</p>

    <p>One of the most important concepts in computer science is how to define new commands. Most computer languages have only about 100 words or commands. And really, the art and magic is in defining your own new words out of these building blocks.</p>

    <p>Once you've taught a computer how to do an action once using this sequence of commands, you can make up your own name for that action so it's easy to repeat it later. When you define your own command and give it a name, that's called a function.</p>

    <p>Hi, I’m Jess. When programming with blocks, you would use functions if there are a set of actions you would like to use lots of times. For example, you've written code to create a square.</p>

<div class='note'>
    <img alt="Frozen3 5" src="assets/notes/frozen3_5.jpg" />
    <p>You can define this as a function called &quot;create a square.&quot;</p>

    <p>Now you have a new block that you can use multiple times to create multiple squares.</p>

    <p>A lot of simple shapes can be used to create more complex patterns. In the next puzzle, the code you recently wrote to make a circle is available to you as a new function that can make circles of different sizes. Can you use it to help Elsa create intricate and beautiful patterns in the snow?</p>
