  <p>An if-else statement is a decision between two things. Let's see how we can use an if-else statement with our buddy Scrat the squirrel.</p>

  <p>This block looks the same as the &quot;if&quot; block, but there's an extra part at the bottom that says &quot;else&quot;. If I put a &quot;move forward&quot; block where it says &quot;do&quot; and a &quot;turn left&quot; block where it says &quot;else&quot;, that means Scrat the squirrel will move forward if there's a path ahead. If there's not a path ahead, Scrat will turn left.</p>

  <p>It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that decision. And just like &quot;if&quot; blocks, you can put &quot;if-else&quot; blocks inside &quot;repeat&quot; blocks.</p>
