  <p>Hi, I'm Bill! Let's learn a new fundamental concept: &quot;If&quot; statements. This is how computers make decisions.</p>

  <p>You use &quot;If&quot; statements yourself everday. Before you go outside each morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket.</p>

  <p>We can tell the zombie to check IF there's path to the left, and if he finds a path to the left, we can have him turn in that direction.</p>

  <p>To write the code for this, let's drag out our &quot;if&quot; block and put a &quot;turn left&quot; block inside it.</p>

  <p>Now, if we put a &quot;move forward&quot; block above it and a &quot;repeat&quot; block around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a path to the left and turn. The &quot;repeat&quot; command is critical, to check for a turn at every step.</p>

  <p>If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them win.</p>

  <p>Have fun using the &quot;if&quot; block!</p>
