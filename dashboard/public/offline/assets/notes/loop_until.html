  <p>Hi, I'm Chris. Before joining the Miami Heat, I went to Georgia Tech to study Computer Science. Let's try our new block, the &quot;repeat until&quot; block.</p>
  <div class='clear'></div>
</div>
<div class='note'>
  <img alt="Hoc3 2" src="/assets/notes/hoc3_2.jpg" />
  <p>What if we didn't know how far the bird had to move to get to the pig?</p>
  <div class='clear'></div>
</div>
<div class='note'>

  <p>If we put a &quot;move forward&quot; block inside the &quot;repeat until&quot; block, the bird will move forward UNTIL it reaches the pig (or crashes into a wall).</p>
  <div class='clear'></div>
</div>
<div class='note'>
  <img alt="Hoc3 4" src="/assets/notes/hoc3_4.jpg" />
  <p>And this is important: just like before, we can put multiple blocks inside the &quot;repeat until&quot; block, and they will all be repeated.</p>
  <div class='clear'></div>
</div>
