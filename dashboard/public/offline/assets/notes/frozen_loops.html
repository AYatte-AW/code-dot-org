    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Paola! Computers are really good at repeating actions. You can count to 10, 20, or 100. But a computer can count to a billion or a trillion. It won't get bored and it will only take a few seconds. Whether it's counting, or drawing, or anything--computers can repeat things hundreds or even billions of times.</p>

    <p>In programming, we call this a loop. A loop is how you repeat your code over and over again. For the next puzzle, your goal is to help Anna create a square with the &quot;Repeat&quot; block.</p>

    <p>Any blocks of code you put inside the &quot;Repeat&quot; block will be repeated in sequence, as many times as you want.</p>

    <p>To draw a square, you can use the &quot;Move Forward&quot; and &quot;Turn Right&quot; block 4 times. But the easier way is to tell the computer to &quot;Move Forward&quot; and &quot;Turn Right by 90 degrees&quot; once, and then tell it to repeat this pair of actions 4 times. To do that, you need to put the &quot;Move Forward&quot; and &quot;Turn Right&quot; block inside a &quot;Repeat&quot; block.</p>

    <p>Remember, you can change the number in the &quot;Repeat&quot; block to anything, and it will repeat what's inside the block that many times.</p>
