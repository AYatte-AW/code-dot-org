However, it’s not expected or required that you go beyond 90 mins for the asynchronous work.\r\n\t* To support the connection between the asynchronous and synchronous components of the modules, and to keep us connected as a community, the asynchronous work ends with a written reflection that will be visible to the entire cohort in the shared slides. As facilitators, we’ll use your responses to those questions to help inform the content of the upcoming synchronous portion of the module. \r\n\r\n** (1 min) Once a month, we’ll come together for the synchronous portion of the module. **\r\n\r\n* Each synchronous workshop is also 90 mins.\r\n* We prioritize activities during our synchronous time that are best completed with other people in real-time: discussions, collaborative exercises, etc. \r\n* At the end of each synchronous workshop, we’ll make sure you know how to find the asynchronous work for the next module.\r\n\r\n\t* You can find the schedule for all of our synchronous workshops on our cohort’s digital digest.
