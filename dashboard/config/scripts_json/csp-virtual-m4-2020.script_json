Unit 6 is similar to previous units in that it features many unplugged activities.  The activities are intended to help students get hands-on practice with content that can otherwise feel abstract.  Much like earlier units, it can be tempting to go deeper than necessary in this unit but the focus should be on the learning objectives.  The learning objectives are aligned to the AP framework so additional depth is not necessary.  \n2. One of the main differences from this unit to prior units is that this unit may privilege students with stronger math backgrounds.  For that reason, it is important to recognize the multiple intelligences in your classroom by considering ahead of time how those intelligences will manifest themselves.  By publicly acknowledging the multiple ways students contribute, you can support building an inclusive classroom environment."
