Don’t worry!  This is likely an issue with how the workshop was scheduled in the dashboard.\n2. Ask your participants to take a few minutes to share their \"gots and needs\" in the chat. This will allow you to receive quick feedback to inform your post-workshop debrief.\n3. Let participants know the survey will be coming via email within a few days, and send participants \"home\" for the day.\n4. Contact your Regional Partner to let them know the survey link didn’t work, and ask the Regional Partner to follow-up with Code.org on the next business day.\n5. Code.org will work with Regional Partner to send the survey link to teachers.",
