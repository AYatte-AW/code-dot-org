Participants brainstorm “Who is CSP really for?”, look at the College Board’s policy on AP enrollment, and discuss ways to ensure who is enrolled in their AP CSP classroom reflects their school as a whole.  \r\n \r\nFrom there, we examine the role perspectives and identities play in the classroom.  Participants will see two case studies of scenes from a CSP classroom and then reflect on how blindspots may play a role in how they interpret those scenes.  That leads into a conversation about how we can make students feel like they belong in CS.  This is especially important as we go into the programming unit where some participants (and students) have more experience than others.  We want participants to think about the role they play in creating a culture of belonging in their classrooms.\r\n",

Specifically, understanding linear functions, (x, y) coordinates, and mathematical reasoning is helpful for this course.\r\n\t* Is an AP course, meaning if students take the AP exam, they may earn a college credit\r\n\t\t* This is the same as any other AP course\r\n* The AP Assessment:\r\n\t* Has a multiple choice assessment that students take in May (like every other AP course)\r\n\t* Contains a project that students finish in class and submit by April 30th.  \r\n\t\t* This is unlike any other AP course with the exception of AP Studio Art.  All other AP exams are taken entirely during the exam time in May. Typically this includes some sort of “free response” section, which AP CSP does not have. \r\n* The role “endorsed providers” play\r\n\t* AP CSP is one of a few courses where the College Board has endorsed providers for curriculum and professional development materials.  Code.org is an endorsed provider for AP CSP, meaning that the College Board has reviewed our curriculum and Professional Development materials and agreed that it meets their standards. Code.org is one of several endorsed providers for AP CS Principles.\r\n\t* Endorsed providers all provide professional development that cover their curriculum and information about the AP course and exam more broadly.   In theory, you could attend more than one of these workshops or go to a College Board sponsored AP Summer Institute to learn about other ways to teach this course.  \r\n\t\t* Every course has opportunities to attend College Board sponsored AP Workshops, but not every course has endorsed providers.",

This shouldn’t be their most troublesome student, but perhaps a student who seemed to slide under the radar or “blend in” with the class. \r\n* In general, be on high alert during the first day of people slipping from roles and gently remind them that they will have time to “think like a teacher” during the debrief.

Students frequently can discover how a widget works.\r\n\t* Teachers have students share out how the widget works after some time to explore so everyone is on the same page. \r\n\t* Teachers have a strategy in place to know when students are ready to discuss what they learned from using the widget. \r\n\t* Teachers connect the computer science knowledge intended for the lesson back to the widget.\r\n\t* Even though students are on computers, incorporating time to collaborate is helpful to keep engagement high during these lessons."

In the register all you have are nine $10 bills, nine $1 bills, and nine dimes.”  What is the largest/smallest amount you could give someone in change?\r\n\t* Students explore the Odometer widget (which we saw on Monday) to see what happens when there aren’t enough places to store large numbers.  This is when overflow happens.\r\n\t* Then we introduce the opposite problem: we don’t have enough spaces to get small values.  To examine this problem, we introduce the “flippy do pro”\r\n\t* Learners look at a series of challenges to try and represent values on the flippy do pro. \r\n\t\t* Facilitator prompt to group: What are all the “fractional values” you can make with the flippy do pro?\r\n\t\t* Facilitator prompt to group: What if I wanted to represent .39 in binary?  I couldn’t do it because we don’t have the right spaces.  How would you round .39 with the given amount of bits you have?\r\n\t* Wrap-up: Learners synthesize the activity and add Overflow Error and Round-off Error as vocabulary to their notebooks.\r\n* Common pitfalls:\r\n\t* Focusing too much on the math.  There are fractions, and exponents, but students don’t need to understand that aspect of the math.  They really need to understand that bits can represent a limited amount of information.  We can add more bits to represent twice as much information, but even that amount of information is limited until we add more bits."

        "description": "This lesson follows Lesson 5.\r\n\r\n* Description:  Students create a system for representing text using only numbers while communicating with each other. They are only allowed to send numbers back-and-forth, so they must create a system to translate between number and character.  This marks a transition from talking about computers representing numbers and computers representing more complex information digitally. \r\n* Learning Goals:\r\n\t* Students will be able to develop a system for using numbers to represent text.\r\n\t* Students will be able to explain how bits are grouped to represent abstractions like numbers and text.\r\n\t* Students will be able to describe the challenges in representing text when using a fixed number of bits for each character.\r\n* Key beats of the lesson:\r\n\t* Warm-up: Show students a set of numbers that they need to interpret.  This primes students for thinking about numbers as representing other information.\r\n\t* Activity:\r\n\t\t* Students work in pairs to communicate to one another text messages but only with using numbers.  Students develop a system and the teacher provides four different challenges to test the system.  One student will “send” the message by passing a note with only numbers on it to their partner who will need to interpret the message based on the rules the two of them agreed upon.  Challenges include sending messages with spaces, punctuation, capitalization and numbers (ex. “C ya 2night!”)\r\n\t\t* After the four challenges students learn about the system computers used called ASCII to communicate through text. \r\n\t\t\t* Open up the ASCII one-pager [link] for the group to look at. \r\n\t\t* Students compare their system to the ASCII system.\r\n\t* Wrap-up: Students learn the vocabulary word “abstraction” which is when we create simplified representations of something more complex. This lets us hide the details and instead focus on problems at a higher level.\r\n* Where this is going:\r\n\t* Following this lesson is the Black and White Images lesson you saw today.  This lesson prepares students for the Black and White Images lesson by transitioning away from numbers and to other types of digital information (in this case, text).",

We start with building mental models of key concepts and ideas so that all students are able to engage with the more technical content later in the lessons. |\r\n| Stereotypes about CS | Due to messages in society and culture, students may have some stereotypes about what people who do CS look like. They may also have some assumptions about what doing CS means (eg., it means you are working alone a lot, it means working on a computer all day, it is all about programming etc.) | We include videos that promote diverse role models that work with computer science. We frequently focus on collaboration with using tools and tasks so that students are rarely working in isolation of their peers. We tell a “people-driven” story about how computer science impacts people. |\r\n| Language demands  | When directions are written at a high reading level, students may not be able to complete a task because of their language skills, not because of their computer science skills. | We are intentional about how we introduce and incorporate CS vocabulary into lessons and resources. We direct all students to use their journals to write down computer science specific vocabulary. We go visual whenever possible.

Students are introduced to the term “User Interface” \r\n\t* Activity: \r\n\t\t* In groups of 2 students look at 5 different apps in Code Studio and discuss\r\n\t\t\t* How does the user interact with the app?\r\n\t\t\t* What is the overall purpose of this app?\r\n\t\t\t* Who is the target audience?\r\n\t\t* They watch a video about how computers work and describe Input, Output, Storage and Processing.\r\n\t\t* Students look at the apps again and identify the inputs and outputs of the apps.\r\n\t* Wrap-up:\r\n\t\t* Students think about the User Interface of their favorite app on their phone and consider the inputs and outputs.\r\n\t\t* Students add vocabulary to their notebooks: User Interface, Input, Output\r\n* Where this is going:\r\n\t* This shows students apps that they will be able to make by the end of this unit.  Students need to have greater awareness around why UIs are important in apps.",

To begin, however, they are introduced to the concept of debugging and are encouraged to use and reflect on this practice throughout the lesson.\r\n* Learning Goals:\r\n\t* Students will be able to debug simple sequential and event-driven programs\r\n\t\t* Ties to LO CRD-2.I: For errors in an algorithm or program: a. Identify the error. b. Correct the error.  \r\n\t* Students will be able to use the debugging process and Identify specific best practices for debugging programs\r\n\t* Students will be able to use the speed slider, break points, and documentation as part of the debugging process\r\n* Key beats of the lesson:\r\n\t* (2 minutes) Students watch a debugging video to introduce the debugging mindset.\r\n\t\t* Show the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auv10y-dN4s) to participants \r\n\t* Students work in pairs to debug 8 different programs in Code Studio\r\n\t\t* Along the way they learn about tools that help them debug\r\n\t\t* The role of the teacher is to reinforce the debugging mindset \r\n\t* To end the class, students share what they learned from debugging and the teacher shares additional debugging “best practices”\r\n\t* Students add vocabulary to their notebooks: documentation and comment\r\n* Where this is going:\r\n\t* This reinforces ideas from the previous lessons and helps build a classroom culture and mindset around debugging.  \r\n\t* This  lesson supports Computational Thinking Practice 4 Code Analysis - Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing.\r\n\t* Students need to be able to read and identify errors code in future lessons as well as on the AP test in the Multiple Choice Section.  This lesson helps build that skill. (include image of AP question)"
