What are you struggling with?\n- Who are some students who have surprised you in class?  What assets do they bring to the classroom and to their work?\n- What are your strategies for supporting students who have missed classes?\n\nThis opener presents an opportunity to talk about equitable classrooms.  As a facilitator, you can connect this to past work by talking about the role of blindspots in the classroom.  It is possible that underestimating students is a side effect of having a blindspot in your teaching practice.  You can also talk about supporting students who missed classes from an equity standpoint.  By sharing out strategies for supporting students who have missed classes, teachers can increase the tools in their “teacher toolbox” for this situation and tailor the solution to the student and the content.\n\nIf this session starts to run long, suggest that the remaining questions go on post-it notes to the question parking lot."

Let’s first go over what happens in the first lesson - U5L1 - Lists Explore.  In this lesson, students build a mental model of a list by using baggies and stickies.  \n\n\n\n\n|Slides&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Speaker Notes |\n|---|---|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/slide1.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}|**Say:** Learning about lists builds on what students know about variables. We’ve already learned that variables can help us store one piece of information.<br><br>But what if we have lots of information?|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/slide2.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** This lesson represents lists as a gallon baggie full of small baggies. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/slide3.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | Diagram of a list.<br><br>**Say:** Your list is made up of elements. Each element has its own index. Indexes are just numbers that count up from zero. The length of the list is how many elements it contains. This list has 3 elements and indexes from 0 to 2.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/slide4.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** Notice that all the bags can folded up and be placed inside the big variable baggie. Sometimes we want to think about the whole list, sometimes we want to think about individual elements. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/slide5.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| How the code works<br><br>**Say:** We create a list with this command. It creates a new list and assigns it to a variable. The square brackets indicate we’re making a list. Each value is separated by commas.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/slide6.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | Accessing elements in a list.<br><br>**Say:** If we want to access the values in our list we use the square brackets next to the name of our list.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-9.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** We can use list accesses inside of expressions, just like variables. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This first expression evaluates to 23 because myNumbers[1] contains 20.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-10.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** We can assign the index of a list just like a variable. <Br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** This code will assign a new value at index 2 of the list. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-14.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** The removeItem command will remove an item from a list. The item at the index given is removed, items to the right are shifted over, and the last index is removed.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-15.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** The appendITem command will add an item to a list. A new index is added to the end of the list and the new item is place in it.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-20-21-U5-Lists-Explore-Slide-16.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** The insertItem command will add an item to the middle of a list. The item is placed in the index given. Then every item is moved over one space to make room. A new index is aded to the end of the list to make room.<br><br>**Do This:** Have students discuss what the list will show after this command.|\n\n<i class=\"fa fa-list-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Review key takeaways from the slides.",
