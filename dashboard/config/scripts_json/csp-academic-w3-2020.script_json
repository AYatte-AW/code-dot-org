One of the requirements of the library is that one of those functions include a parameter, return, a loop, and an if-statement.

I could use it to make lots of different types and sizes of cake. <br><br> ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries5.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** Ok, let's make our cake. Remember, each time I come across `tiers` or `flavor`, I'm going to replace that word with the appropriate value. Once I'm done, I will have baked a 3 layer lemon cake! <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** There are several steps to click through here.

It should look familiar, but it has a few extra parts. This function has parameters. Parameters are used as plaeholders for values that will be passed through the function. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> **Say:** Those values passed to the parameter are called arguments. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-3.10.03-PM.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** Having a function with parameters allows our function to be used for a greater variety of purposes.  Imagine if I created a function for makeLemonCake,makeChocolateCake, and makeVanillaCake… it could go on for awhile! <br><br> By creating a function with parameters, I can create different outputs more easily by giving it different values or arguments. <br><br> This summarizes the need for functions with parameters. <br><br>In the lesson plan, this is also when students are given an activity guide that asks them to create a function that describes how to make a house with given parameters.  Students use the manipulatives to create the function and write the directions inside the function in pseudocode.|\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries9.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** The second half of the lesson is dedicated to understanding how “return” works.  To do this, we look at a function “cakeCost”.  It has tiers and flavor also as parameters. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation**   |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries10.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** Let's open the envelope and check out how this function works. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries11.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** There are a few new things here. First, we've created two local variables. Remember, the local variables are contained within the function and can't be updated or accessed outside of the function. We learned about this when we discussed variable scope. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> In this function, a decision (in this case, how much to charge per flavor) is made based on the argument passed through the parameter. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation** <br><br> Finally, the total is returned, but returned where?

Where is it returned? To the place in the program where the function was called.  |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries16.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** Here's how this looks in JavaScript. It's ok if it's a little confusing. You'll get to play with this in Code Studio in the next lesson. For now, notice how the statement is set up. A variable is set up with the name `cakeCalculator`. This gets the value that is returned from the function `cakeCost` which has two arguments `3` and `lemon` passed through the parameters. After the function is evaluated, `cakeCalculator` now stores the value 12. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Returns,-and-Libraries17.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| **Say:** We can also print to the console like so. <br><br> **Do This: Read through as a class. |\n| ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-3.19.46-PM.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"}| After we walk through this as a class, students complete a second challenge in the activity guide to create a function that returns the cost of building a house.|"

To understand the content of the lesson\n2. To plan how you can support an inclusive classroom \n\nWhile thinking about creating an inclusive classroom, you may want to consider some of the ideas we discussed in the Explore lesson.  Some other ideas to consider are:\n\n* Encouraging students to focus on the problem-solving process (not just the product)\n* Supporting students taking risks\n* Building relationships with students to identify opportunities to connect learning to their personal experience.\n* Maintaining high expectations for all students to counter stereotypes about who should excel in CS.\n* Grounding concepts in the real world is good practice in any classroom.\n* Differentiating in a way that is inclusive\n* Recognizing students’ specific skills that they bring to the classroom\n\nOur goal is to be as concrete as possible when planning how to support an inclusive classroom.

We recently learned about functions with parameters and return values. <br><br>![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/animation.png) **Click for animation:** Click until the library definition appears on the screen. <br><br> **Say:** These envelopes represent functions. <br><br>The envelopes have been grouped together in a folder. This represents a library. A library is a collection of functions that can be used in many different programs.<br><br>Let’s look inside.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries23.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} |**Say:** Let's take a look at what's inside the library. If we open up the folder, we see the functions and some documentation. A library should have documentation for each of the included functions. The documentation should include: <ul><li>how each function works</li><li>a complete list of the parameters</li><li>what (if anything) will be returned</li></ul><br><br>This detailed type of documentation is also known as Application Program Interface(API). APIs are specifications for how the functions in a library behave and can be used.|\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries30.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} | **Say:** Libraries allow code to be easily used and shared.  Imagine if I were a cake shop owner.  I might have a website for customers that would use some of this code.  I might also have cash registers at my store that use this code.  Or maybe I have automated the cake making process and the machines that make the cakes could use this code.  Having one library that contains all of this code means that I can easily use this same code in a variety of different apps.  I could even share this code with a different branch of my cake making business. |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/CSP-Unit-7_-Parameters,-Return,-and-Libraries31.svg){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} |**Say:** You've seen libraries in action before. The Math library is built into App Lab. Notice the name of the library first, then after a dot, the name of the function and finally the parameters. This is the same formatting you will use to call functions in libraries: Library name, followed by function name, and finally the parameter(s) |\n|![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-2.59.36-PM.png){: style=\"border:1px solid black; width:200px\"} |**Do This:** Have participants navigate to U7L6 - Level 3. <br><br> Have participants follow along on their computers as you demo:<ul><li>The functions drawer to show which functions are there and the documentation included.</li><li>Getting to the libraries using the gear icon</li></ul>|\n\nReminder: While students do not need to use a library in their Create PT, the concept is still in the framework for AP CS Principles, so it may be tested on the AP exam.
