Make sure all the teachers in your workshop take the survey before they leave.  \n\t* During the closing session of the even-numbered modules (M2, M4, M6, M8) CLOSE THE WORKSHOP. Follow the instructions found in the [Facilitator Tools Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xhl4SnjVYycLOxE_BiVrZnhX-bwfL4Cik_PZkuWBn2s/preview). If you are only facilitating an odd-numbered module today (M1, M3, M5,or M7) DO NOT CLOSE THE WORKSHOP.  \n\n\n* If you are facilitating two modules today:\n\t* During the closing session of the second module (M2, M4, M6, M8), show the slide at the end of the deck that includes the appropriate link based on your virtual workshop model.  Make sure all the teachers in your workshop take the survey before they leave. On the [workshop dashboard](https://studio.code.org/pd/workshop_dashboard/workshops) find your workshop and CLOSE THE WORKSHOP. Follow the instructions found in the [Facilitator Tools Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xhl4SnjVYycLOxE_BiVrZnhX-bwfL4Cik_PZkuWBn2s/preview). \n\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Having trouble with the survey?\nIf your participants get an error message when you share the survey link, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Don’t worry!  This is likely an issue with how the workshop was scheduled in the dashboard.\n2. Ask your participants to take a few minutes to share their \"gots and needs\" in the chat. This will allow you to receive quick feedback to inform your post-workshop debrief.\n3. Let participants know the survey will be coming via email within a few days, and send participants \"home\" for the day.\n4. Contact your Regional Partner to let them know the survey link didn’t work, and ask the Regional Partner to follow-up with Code.org on the next business day.\n5. Code.org will work with Regional Partner to send the survey link to teachers.",
