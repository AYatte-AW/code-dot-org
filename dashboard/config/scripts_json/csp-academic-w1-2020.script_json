Each letter represents a different type of lesson (E - Explore, I - Investigate, P - Practice, M - Make) which are taught in sequence for each major programming construct.\n* Go over each lesson type in a bit more detail using the [EIPM: A Short Introduction document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncil5b0yWAN4LCyOeXwYuNrNKEHtN4nmAd2o-_K5Psw/edit)\n\t* Explore lessons\n\t\t* The goal is that students begin to develop a shared mental model and understand the main ideas of the new concept.\n\t\t* Students explore the new concept through a teacher-led hands-on group activity, typically with manipulatives.\n\t* Investigate Lessons\n\t\t* The goal is that students become comfortable reading and modifying programs that use the new concept.\n\t\t* Students investigate two or three sample programs that use the new concept.  During this lesson, students are reading and making sense of working code and having frequent teacher-led discussions about what students are seeing on the screen.\n\t* Practice Lessons\n\t\t* The goal of this lesson is for students to gain confidence in writing and debugging programs that use the new concept.\n\t\t* Students practice using the new concept through a scaffolded series of programming activities.  The teacher supports by helping students develop debugging skills and helping them think through their tasks.\n\t* Make lessons\n\t\t* The goal of this lesson is for students to have more independence when deciding when and how to use the new concept in the context of a larger project.  \n\t\t* Students make a target app for which they are given the screen elements but little to no starter code.  The teacher provides targeted individual or whole class support to help students understand the task\n* There are multiple EIPM sequences per Unit.  Each lesson is still only 45 minutes. \n* The role of the teacher and student shift throughout the sequence.  \n* Overall, the goal of EIPM is to give both teachers and students structure in teaching and learning programming in a way that is aligned to the same “feel” of learning and teaching experienced in earlier units.",
