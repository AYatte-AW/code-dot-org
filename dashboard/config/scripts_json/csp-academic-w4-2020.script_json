Below are sample transitional remarks along with what we are asking you to highlight in U9L4.\n\n**Lesson 1-2 transitional remarks:**  After lesson 1, students are familiar with looking at the data behind the data as well as making sense of a variety of different charts in Google Trends.  While students do a lot of exploration during this lesson, the following lesson we focus on datasets in App Lab and reading bar charts and histograms.\n\n**Lesson 2-3 transitional remarks:**  In Lesson 2, students worked with a pretty easy to understand dataset.  But datasets aren’t always that straight forward.  In the next lesson we will see that depending on how data is collected, data scientists might need to modify the dataset before they even get to creating visualizations of that data. \n\n**Lesson 3-4 transitional remarks:**  In Lesson 3, students also learned that sometimes it is helpful to “drill down” into a smaller data set, much like how we drilled down to see the distribution of ages in “TheRoots” dataset earlier today.  In this next lesson, we will see drill down to another layer of analysis as we create more complex data visualizations.\n\n**Lesson 4:**  Facilitator-led overview"

Since then, we have gone through much of the material in Code.org’s CSP curriculum, discussed teaching CSP with an equitable lens, brainstormed solutions to problems, and began to more fully understand the AP Exam.  While we covered a lot of content, and we hope that this stays with you beyond this year, we also want to acknowledge the community we have built here and also connect you with the larger CS community.  \n\nTeaching itself can be an isolating career.  Teaching CS often means you have even fewer colleagues who understand the unique challenges of teaching the topic.  We have come together periodically for these events, but knowing that this is our last official workshop together we want to pause to think about what getting support will look like in the future.",
