For example you might say “Many of you mentioned that you felt most comfortable with your understanding of the Explore lesson type.  Austen said “The Explore lesson type feels like what we did during our summer workshop and what I have done in my classroom as a math teacher so I feel most comfortable with that”.  Pulling direct quotes from the asynchronous work is intended to:\n\n* Reassure participants who did the asynchronous work that the asynchronous work is important to their own learning and the learning of the community.\n* Support participants who did not do the asynchronous work by giving them insight to where the rest of the group is.\n* Pull out and connect ideas from the asynchronous work to the synchronous work.  In this example, we are going to dive deeper into the Explore lesson on Variables during this workshop, so drawing the connection to what they learned about EIPM and focusing on Explore task helps foreshadow what the participants will engage in during  this workshop."
